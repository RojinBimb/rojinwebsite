	<!--First research reference of our websites-->
	<div class="samsung">
		<h2>1. Samsung.com</h2>
		
		<img src="Images/Research 1 samsung.png" style="width: 1300px;height: 400px;margin: 20px;border: 3px solid">
		<p>
			It can be seen that this project shares some ressemblance with the samsung home page. Both of them contains a
			similar layout with the logo at the top left but the navbar is at different positions despite being at the top
			with mine being at the top right and samsung having it at the center top. Samsung also has some functionalaties
			at the top-right which my project lacks. The next similarity in appearance can be seen at the center area. Both of them contains a text and a button on the left side and a picture on the right side. But there is a difference that samsung the image as a whole as a slider. The last difference and the most noticable is the background where i have used a multicolored background and the samsung company has a rather plain background.

	<!--Second research reference of our websites-->
	<div class="dealayo">
		<h2>2. Dealayo.com</h2>
		<img src="Images/Research 2 dealayo.png" style="width: 1300px;height: 400px;margin: 20px;border: 3px solid">
		<p>
			Some little similarities in the product page can also be seen with a site named dealayo. Although they are not that much similar, a slight similarity in the display layout can be seen in both the websites. The first noticable difference is that the dealayo website does not use a table border at all whereas I have used a rather thick and visible border to make a partition between the different products. The next noticable one is the discount text and the yellow backgroynd in the tet area of my project. the final major difference is the fact that they actually do not have a dedicated button to purchase the products directly from this page and also has the add to cart option displayed as a heart at the top left where I put a simple button in mine. A minimal difference is that they have the prices displayed in nepalese currency whereas I have provided the price in dollars although the prices may not be real.

	<!--Third research reference of our websites-->
		<div class="khalti">
		<h2>3. Khalti.com</h2>
		<img src="Images/Research 3 khalti.png" style="width: 1300px;height: 400px;margin: 20px;border: 3px solid">
		<p>
			The reference and idea behind the footer of my website is khalti, one of the biggest and most used e-wallet app of nepal. Although no great similarities can be seen between my website and the footer of Khalti website, the concept is somewhat similar. Both of our pages contains a solid and different coloured background colour and cantains some useful information about our website. The major difference is that the khalti website has several columns of data whereas mine has only few data on the left and right side. There is also a kind of contant access in the khalti website which is not present in my page and I have it to a different page.

	<!--Fourth research reference of our websites-->
	<div class="esewa">
		<h2>4. Esewa.com</h2>
		<img src="Images/Research 4 esewa.png" style="width: 1300px;height: 400px;margin: 20px;border: 3px solid">
		<p>
			It can be seen that the blog page of my website has some resemblance with the blog page of esewa, another widely used e-wallet in Nepal. Both of has used a image with cotext to our subject and some paragraph about the topics in our website. Esewa has chosen the KYC information whereas I have chosen a paragraph about the effects of technology in our daily life. They have used an image above and the text below it whereas I have used the float property to bring the image to the right and the text is then written on the left side of the screen. They also have not used as much line spacing as I have.

	<!--Fifth research reference of our websites-->
	<div class="freshworks">
		<h2>5. Freshworks.com</h2>
		<img src="Images/Research 5 freshworks.png" style="width: 1300px;height: 400px;margin: 20px;border: 3px solid">
		<p>
			 Although the feedback form is almost similar in all the websites, this one called freshworks.com shares a really close identity with my form page. We can see two columns, one with the actual form and the other with a sort of social media links and information. The coluns are reversed among the two of us and also mine consists two different background colours as well whereas they have used a single colored background for both of their columns.
